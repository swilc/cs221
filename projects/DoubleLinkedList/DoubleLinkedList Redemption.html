</head><body><center><h1> Programming assignment follow-up: DoubleLinkedList Redemption</h1>
<h2>earn extra-credit for addressing test failures from the DLL project</h2></center>

<h3> Description: </h3> 
<p>Fix as many issues with your <a href="https://westadacs.codehs.me/cs221/projects/DoubleLinkedList/DoubleLinkedList.html">DoubleLinkedList</a> as you can, as identified by the instructors' test suite results.
<br><br>
Your improved DLL will be retested and 75% of the difference between your original 
testing score and your improved testing score (rounded) will be awarded extra-credit points.
<br><br>
Note: The only part of the project being considered, here, is the functionality of your DLL as determined by running the instructors' test suite.
Nothing else from the project (README, your ListTester class, etc.) will be reevaluated.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Your original DLL passed 50% of the instructor tests (25/50 points).
You work to address failed tests and your improved DLL passes 80% of the instructor tests (40/50 points).
You receive (40-25)*0.75 = 11 points extra-credit.
</p>
